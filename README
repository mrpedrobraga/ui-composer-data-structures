# UI Composer Data Structures

[UI Composer](https://mrpedrobraga.com/software/ui-composer) is a rust library for creating user interfaces.
It notably uses something called 'the Editor pattern', where UI itself lacks any state and, instead, "observes"
and edits external state.

For example, a `Checkbox` edits a `bool`, a `TextEdit` edits a `String`, a `Button` edits an `FnMut`, etc...
And compositions of primitives (like structs, enums) are edited by containers.

This crate provides some extra common data structures for creating UI around like paginators, alerts, cards.
